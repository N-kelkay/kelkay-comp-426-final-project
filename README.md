# Enhanced MetaMask Wallet Experience

## Contributors: Natnael Kelkay (pid: 730411156), Sathvik Kaza (pid: 730484935)

## Project Overview

This project aims to improve the user experience of MetaMask wallet users by introducing the Wallet Card feature. This feature includes functionality such as connecting to MetaMask wallets, sending ETH payments, managing multi-signature wallets, and creating a Safe CORE Smart Wallet. Our goal is to make digital asset management more secure, flexible, and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Wallet Card Integration**: Connect seamlessly with MetaMask wallets.
- **ETH Payments**: Send ETH to any external Ethereum address directly through the interface.
- **Multi-Signature Wallet**: Enhance security by requiring multiple approvals for transactions.
- **Safe CORE Smart Wallet**: Create and manage a shared wallet with customizable ownership and approval thresholds.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: React.js, Bulma (CSS Framework)
- **Back-End**: Express.js (Node.js framework)
- **APIs**:
  - Etherscan API: For retrieving transaction and wallet data.
  - Ethereum Blockchain API: For user authentication and session persistence.

- run `npm install`
- run `node server.js`
- backend should be running!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
